## CNN implementation using tensorflow

What is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)?
Convolutional neural network is a regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns feature engineering by itself via filters optimization. Vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, seen during backpropagation in earlier neural networks, are prevented by using regularized weights over fewer connections.
